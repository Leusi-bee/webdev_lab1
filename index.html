  <h1>Hello world. This is my first website!</h1>
    <p>I am learning something completely new.</p>
    <p>Hoping to get the hang of this soon.</p>
    <p>Can't wait to fund my travels with web development. :-)</p>

    <h3>Assignment</h3>
      <p>I do <strong>not</strong> understand what I'm supposed to be doing. I feel like there is a whole lecture that I have missed... so I'm just typing things and trying out different elements.</p>
      <p>I find this quite difficult when there is no one to ask questions about anything... lets hope that with time everything will start to make sense!</p>
